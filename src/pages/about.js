      <h1>About Kinoji</h1>

      <p>Kinoji is an online cinematography library focused on Asia and author cinema. The movies were simply chosen because I found their cinematography successful or inspiring</p>
      <p>You may find in this selection a lot of Asians or SF movies, two genres in which I find great inspirations, for many reasons...</p>
      <p>The list has been done without any pretention, I do not consider myself as a Cinephile. Thus, there are a lot of chance you won't find the <i>Grands crus</i> of cinema history. Those are just movies that had an emotional impact on me or that I found had a clear cinematography or art direction quality.</p>
